This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup using NPM

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```


### project Setup using YARN

If you prefer to use `yarn`, and you don't have it installed, you can install it globally via npm:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

With `yarn` installed, you can now proceed as follows:

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Compile and hot-reload for development:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Compile and minify for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Choose the set of commands corresponding to the package manager you're using. Both `npm` and `yarn` will correctly handle the project setup, development, and build process as defined in `package.json`.
